# Modeling_and_Simulation_for_DC_Motor

## ðŸ”¹ Abstract
This project focuses on modeling, simulation, and control of a DC motor system.  
The motorâ€™s electrical and mechanical parameters were estimated through experimental testing and simulation. **MATLAB/Simulink** was used to develop a mathematical model and verify motor dynamics.  
A **PID controller** was designed and tuned to regulate motor speed using PWM signals.  
The control algorithm was implemented in **C++** and tested on hardware.  
Verification was performed using **Proteus simulation** and **SerialPlot visualization**, ensuring consistency between theoretical modeling and real-world performance.
